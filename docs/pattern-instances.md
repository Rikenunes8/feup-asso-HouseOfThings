# House of Things â€“ Pattern Instances

<!-- Why document pattern instances

Documenting pattern instances helps other developers understand a system, with its concrete classes, attributes and methods, and the design decisions behind them. This provides a level of abstraction higher than the class level, highlighting commonalities and thus promoting the understandability, conciseness and consistency of the documentation. At the same time, the documentation of pattern instances help developers to certify themselves that they're taking the right decisions. In general terms, this results in better communication in the development team and, consequently, in less bugs.

The documentation of pattern instances, allows other designers to learn from them and makes it possible to trace the design path from the problem to the implementation of the solution. It can easily reflect the similarities and differences between the several problems encountered during analysis and design, and contribute to eventually finding common compositions of patterns that are particular to the problem domain at hand, thus promoting the understandability, conciseness and consistency of the documentation, and preserving development knowledge.

<!-- How to write pattern instance documentation

To formally document a pattern instance we must describe the design context, the design problem to solve, why the pattern was selected given the context and problem, how the pattern roles, operations and associations are mapped to the concrete design classes and the consequences of instantiating the pattern. You can find an example of this kind of documentation in the third section of ["JUnit: A Cook's Tour"](https://web.archive.org/web/20221128004056/junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookstour/cookstour.htm). 

Likewise, in this document each section should describe a different pattern instance. Name the sections according to the design problems that you have solved, and structure them according to the following sub-sections:

 * **Problem in Context.** Describe the wider design context and the concrete problem to be solved. This must be as complete as possible, someone else other than the original designer should be able to read and understand why it was important (and not trivial) to solve this problem.
 * **The Pattern.** Identify the pattern that you applied, why it was selected and how it is a good fit considering the existing design context and the problem at hand. Must include:
   * An enumeration and brief description of how the pattern _roles_, _operations_ and _associations_ were mapped to your concrete implementation. 
   * Links to the corresponding source code blocks on your implementation.
   * Figure(s) illustrating your implementation of the pattern (e.g., class diagram, activity diagram).
 * **Consequences.** Benefits and liabilities (pros and cons) of the design after pattern instantiation, and comparison of these consequences with those of alternative solutions. This section should _not_ describe generic consequences of the pattern, but the specific ones of applying the pattern in your system.
